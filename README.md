# Website-Classification
I am attempting to use machine learning to help classify websites using content from a list of urls that were webscraped.
### Process (Completed):
1. Get a list of 400 URLs on food pantries.
2. Scrape the content from those URLs.
3. Build a classifier that will effectively distinguish a website that has a list of food pantries resources from a website that does not (87% accurate so far).

### Process (Not Completed):
1. Apply trained model from above to new dataset that has single sources and list sources from different categories (Senior Centers, Homeless Shelters, etc)
2. Evaluate results
3. Question: Do I need to build a classifier for each category or will this apply to all categories?
